# TODO (sanitization, before customer #2):
#   The PROMPTS list below contains L&R-instance-flavored personal stories
#   (mentions team members + a property by name). The structure of the script
#   is vendor-layer; the *content* is instance-layer. Refactor to load prompts
#   from a customer-supplied YAML file (e.g. ~/.config/eve/prompt_seed.yaml),
#   matching how cadence_model.yaml and interest_profile.yaml already work.
"""Seed Eve-originated reflective prompts into the knowledge DB as 'items'.

Unlike RSS items (pulled from external feeds), these are conversation seeds
Eve carries — short prompts she can adapt at send-time to ask team members
something personal or reflective. They live in the same `items` table with a
distinguishing `source = 'eve_prompts'` marker, so the relevance scorer +
cadence recommender treat them like any other item but the Phase 3 outreach
step knows to *adapt + speak in Eve's voice* rather than just forward a link.

Idempotent — uses synthetic URLs as unique keys; reseeding doesn't duplicate.

Usage:
    prompt_seed.py             # seed (or refresh) the prompt set
    prompt_seed.py --reset     # delete all eve_prompts items first
